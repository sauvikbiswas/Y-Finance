## An idea borrowed from our forefathers

If you have not recognised yet what buckets are, let me tell you about something that we have often seen in Indian families--especially the older folks. Whenever they got paid--usually at the end of a month--they would seggregate the money in various envelopes (or repurposed *pan-masala* tin cans as my grandfather did). Each envelope would have a purpose. There was one meant for grocery shopping (just like our *Consumables* spend-bucket). Whenever it was necessary to buy someting from the vegetable market, the milkman, or the local grocery store, money would be taken out from that particular envelope, and that was irrespective of who made the shopping trip. There were envelopes that fulfilled their purpose once a year. For example, the one that would be for buing new clothing during the October festival season (Durga Puja / Dussehra). If we had to save 300 rupees for buying new clothes for everyone (300! Look what inflation has done!), we would put 25 rupees every month in that envelope starting from November, until we had 300 rupees in October next year. A well-planned expense--no matter how large--will never create any agony, or worse, a feeling of guilt.

Companies like [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) have monetised this well. Honestly, you don't need to pay for any subscriptions to do so. Any spreadsheet software (Excel, Numbers, Libre Office, Google Sheet) will do once you have understood the philosophy. They are all tools to solve a purpose--improve your financial situation. The purpose is important; the tool isn't. You can even use pen and paper to do this.

## Creating the spreadsheet

The first idea comes from an age old adage--every rupee you earn should have a purpose. You have already done the exercise to identify various buckets. This puts you in a very strong position to determine what are the various purposes of your income.

This spreadsheet that you will be making is a mechanism to track your cash flow. Each sheet in the spreadsheet file would track your cash flow for a given month. First, let us study a sample spreadsheet [ [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NBQ0ukGvi1ol4Tt8KNxo6i3NckpZpfzG81j4gBsgFC8/edit#gid=0) ]. Please feel free to make a copy and play around.

The spreadsheet has some columns whose purpose would have become familiar to you by now, such as the **Bucket Class** and the various entries in that column, as well as the **Bucket** column whose entries you would have already identified by now.

We also see a bucket class called income. It is also a negative number. (Finance people use parenthesis instead of a minus sign. Convention; go figure!) Well, it was bound to be there. After all this is a record of cash flow--there has to be some kind of inflow as well.

The sum of the entire **Plan for this month** column should be equal to (or close to) zero. This means that all your income (denoted by a negative number) has been allocated for some kind of an outcome (denoted by a positive number). This will ensure that every rupee you earn has a purpose, even if the purpose is hedonistic in nature (or altruistic, or ascetic--there are only three things you can do with your money and by now you know that very well). This would be your next task--

>& Balance your income with your plan

If you are setting this up for the first time, chances are that you wouldn't have any money accumulated in any of the buckets. You can set all entries under **Carry over from previous month** to zero. The **Available money in the bucket** is a summation of your current plan and the carry over from the previous month. As you fill the **Actuals** column with the actuals, the money that is left over in the bucket will be carried forward to the next month. And that's exactly what **Carry forward to the next month** computes.

You can use the standard spreadsheet "=<Sheet-Name>!<Cell>" formula to link them (just like in the sample sheet) or manually copy them prior to next month's planning like my sister does.
